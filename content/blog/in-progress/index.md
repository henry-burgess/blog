I'm looking forward to migrating my current blog instance (Wordpress) to GitHub pages, given the entirely static
content.

In addition, I've moved away from Namecheap, given a number of shady business practices that have been brought to my
attention.

I will be transitioning all the Wordpress content onto this blog, and using Markdown directly to write any posts!
