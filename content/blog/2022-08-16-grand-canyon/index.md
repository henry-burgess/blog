We first landed in Las Vegas, and drove through the night to catch sunrise at the **North Rim** of Grand Canyon National Park, AZ.

Here I am on the edge of the canyon, a bit more up-close and personal with steep drop.

Another view of the North Rim for good measure!

The North Rim and the South Rim of the Grand Canyon have different entry points depending on how you approach the park. It's worth noting that the South Rim is the more "touristy" side, and the North Rim is a little quieter (but no less spectactular). There's also cabin accomodation and a restaurant with views over the canyon.

One can hike down and through the canyon to the other side, but this isn't typically a day hike. Check conditions and plan to split the hike over two days, the inclines on the North Rim are brutal, and I'm confident the South Rim wouldn't be much better! Still, worth doing if you have the ability.
