Clouds Rest felt like a hidden gem inside of Yosemite National Park - it required entering the park from another entrance.
It is actually a higher point than Half Dome, and provides a great view over the main highlights of the park.

There was a fair amount of smoke lingering due to the nearby wildfires, but you could still clearly see the scale of the
park and just how high Half Dome was!

Reaching the summit of this hike required a bit of a scramble, and had moments where there was significant exposure, which
probably isn't everyone's cup of tea.

There were some pretty spots along the way worth noting.

I recall this being a slightly longer hike, but definitely a solid day hike in Yosemite with a little less traffic!
